# TrendyCart 


TrendyCart is a robust e-commerce platform built using React (Vite) for efficient development, Redux for state management, and TailwindCSS for rapid UI development. The application dynamically fetches product data from [https://dummyjson.com](dummyjson), offering a wide range of products. To enhance user experience, TrendyCart incorporates pagination for easy product navigation and a powerful search function to help users quickly find desired items. The dynamic cart system allows users to seamlessly add, remove, and view their selected products. This project demonstrates my skills in building scalable e-commerce applications, including API integration, state management, UI development, and implementing advanced features like pagination and search.
